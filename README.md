# Specifications

+ The tool has to be hosted/deployed as a web app:
+ It will receive as input a shapefile with the area of interest (aoi).
+ It will calculate the soils loss based in the (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) RUSLE equation.
    + It will give the option to the user to load his own layers for the RUSLE as shapefiles.
    + If some layer is not provided, it will use the remote sensing proxies retrieved from Google Earth Engine (using python API).
+ The output will be visualized as a map showing the soil loss and alternativelly, it will display the intermediate layers for the calculation of it.

The error you're encountering is due to Mermaid not interpreting the `|` character properly in the label text. To fix this, you should use the `-->` syntax without the `|` characters or split the conditions into separate arrows. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:
